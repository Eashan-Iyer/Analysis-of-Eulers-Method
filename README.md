# Analysis-of-Eulers-Method
Many differential equations are not solvable. In response, numerical estimation techniques such as Euler's method are used to obtain solutions. This repository houses a python implementation of Euler's method.

The solution is visualized in Matplotlib. We present a relationship between the delta x value, the local error, and the global error. Delta x is quadratic with respect to local error, and linear with respect to global error. A paper was written in more detail about this. This was submitted as a project for my AP Calculus BC class
